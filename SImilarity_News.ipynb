Today in the country there are only five medical centers in the largest cities - in Kaunas, Klaipeda, Siauliai, Panevezys and Vilnius. In the districts, something like paramedic points remained for emergency assistance.\\nIf there are few hospitals, then there are few doctors - and today this problem is one of the main ones, we have to involve senior students of medical universities in the fight against the epidemic, but all the same, specialists are sorely lacking.\\nThe Minister of Defense of Lithuania Raimundas Karoblis has already promised that the military will be sent to help the doctors, but would anyone really want him to be treated not by a doctor, but, for example, by an artilleryman?\\nThe second problem associated with the consequences of “democratic reforms” is that the country does not have strategic food supplies. Although just a few days ago, on March 19, the Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernialis assured the country\\'s population that there were enough products in the “bins of the motherland” and there was no cause for concern. But everything was spoiled by the ex-Minister of Agriculture Kazis Starkevičius, who told reporters that there is cause for concern and that it lies in the fact that Lithuania does not have a strategic supply of food.\\n“In 2010, in case of emergency, 200 thousand cans of canned pork, 3.5 thousand tons of wheat flour, 1.6 thousand tons of rice, 1.3 thousand tons of semolina, 700 tons of sugar were bought for state reserve warehouses. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, today the food reserve consists only of grain and sugar. The remaining reserves are eaten, \"\\n- said Kazis Starkevičius.\\nAccording to him, in 2012 amendments to the law on the state reserve were adopted, according to which \"reserves were accumulated on the basis of preliminary agreements.\" This meant that companies, receiving money in advance, pledged in an extreme situation to supply everything necessary for the needs of the population. However, today no one really knows which companies are suppliers, moreover, in the context of the global crisis, whether these suppliers can provide the country with everything necessary is unknown.\\nStarkevičius recalled that in January of this year alone, more than 9 thousand tons of chicken meat was produced in Lithuania, 40% of which was exported, and the rest was eaten. And nothing fell into the state reserve.\\nThe ex-head of the Ministry of Agriculture insists that it is urgent to provide assistance to farmers, who today not only have nothing to buy fertilizers and spare parts for machinery, but it’s generally impossible to buy planting stock due to quarantine restrictions. This year\\'s harvest is already at stake, Starkevičius warned.\\nAgainst this background, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, speaking on Monday, March 23, said that there is a possibility of imposing martial law in the country. The command of the army will present its plan for the introduction of martial law on Tuesday, March 24.\\nSob. correspondent FSK'"

              "['The coronavirus epidemic in Lithuania has clearly demonstrated the results of democratic reforms on the way to a bright European future At the very beginning of the ХХl century the optimization of medicine and health care was carried out in Lithuania as a result of which the number of medical institutions was sharply reduced all small ones were closed and only large ones were left Today in the country there are only five medical centers in the largest cities in Kaunas Klaipeda Siauliai Panevezys and Vilnius In the districts something like paramedic points remained for emergency assistance If there are few hospitals then there are few doctors and today this problem is one of the main ones we have to involve senior students of medical universities in the fight against the epidemic but all the same specialists are sorely lacking The Minister of Defense of Lithuania Raimundas Karoblis has already promised that the military will be sent to help the doctors but would anyone really want him to be treated not by a doctor but for example by an artilleryman The second problem associated with the consequences of democratic reforms is that the country does not have strategic food supplies Although just a few days ago on March 19 the Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernialis assured the countrys population that there were enough products in the bins of the motherland and there was no cause for concern But everything was spoiled by the ex Minister of Agriculture Kazis Starkevičius who told reporters that there is cause for concern and that it lies in the fact that Lithuania does not have a strategic supply of food In 2010 in case of emergency 200 thousand cans of canned pork 3 5 thousand tons of wheat flour 1 6 thousand tons of rice 1 3 thousand tons of semolina 700 tons of sugar were bought for state reserve warehouses According to the Ministry of Agriculture today the food reserve consists only of grain and sugar The remaining reserves are eaten said Kazis Starkevičius According to him in 2012 amendments to the law on the state reserve were adopted according to which reserves were accumulated on the basis of preliminary agreements This meant that companies receiving money in advance pledged in an extreme situation to supply everything necessary for the needs of the population However today no one really knows which companies are suppliers moreover in the context of the global crisis whether these suppliers can provide the country with everything necessary is unknown Starkevičius recalled that in January of this year alone more than 9 thousand tons of chicken meat was produced in Lithuania 40 of which was exported and the rest was eaten And nothing fell into the state reserve The ex head of the Ministry of Agriculture insists that it is urgent to provide assistance to farmers who today not only have nothing to buy fertilizers and spare parts for machinery but it s generally impossible to buy planting stock due to quarantine restrictions This years harvest is already at stake Starkevičius warned Against this background Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda speaking on Monday March 23 said that there is a possibility of imposing martial law in the country The command of the army will present its plan for the introduction of martial law on Tuesday March 24 Sob correspondent FSK']"
